- a variable is a container
- PowerShell contains many built-in and predefined variables
  but we can create our own variables

- Variables are peristent on a PowerShell session : if the session is closed
  variables don't exist anymore

- For creating a variable we use the following syntax : 
  $VariableName = value
  PS : name of variable starts with '$'
